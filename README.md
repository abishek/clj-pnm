# clj-pnm

A Clojure(Script) library for reading and writing Netpbm format.
Currently supports *p1* (*.pbm*), *p2* (*.pgm*) and *p3* (*.ppm*) formats.

The library is in the proof of concept stage and there are a couple of
features that are still missing. The format ignores whitespace, however *clj-pnm*
requires that characters are separated. Binary formats, *p4*, *p5* and *p6* are
not supported. [*pam*](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pam.html) format is also
not supported.

Good explanation of the format and the resources that are used as guides
for this library can be found [here](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html)
and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format).

## Usage

Read the *pbm* format:
``` clojure
(require '[clj-pnm.core :as pnm])
=> nil

(def pbm
"P1
 2
 2
 1 1
 1 1")
=> #'user/pbm

(pnm/read-pnm pbm)
=> {:type :p1, :width 2, :height 2, :map [[1 1] [1 1]]}
```

Read the *pgm* format:
```clojure
(def pgm
"P2
 3
 2
 4
 1 2 3
 4 3 2")
=> #'user/pgm

(pnm/read-pnm pgm)
=> {:type :p2, :width 3, :height 2, :max-value 4, :map [[1 2 3] [4 3 2]]}
```

And finally, read the *ppm* format:
```clojure
(def ppm
"P3
 2
 2
 255
 255 0 255 128 52 123
 0 0 0 45 45 45")
=> #'user/ppm

(pnm/read-pnm ppm)
=> {:type :p3
    :width 2
    :height 2
    :max-value 255
    :map [[(255 0 255) (128 52 123)]
          [(0 0 0) (45 45 45)]]} ; prettified
```

You can extract comments if necessary:
```clojure
(def pbm-with-comments
"P1
 1
 1
 # A comment
 # Another comment
 1")
=> #'user/pbm-with-comments

(pnm/get-comments (pnm/read-lines pbm-with-comments))
=> ("A comment" "Another comment")
```

Clojure version of *clj-pnm* can work with files. To read a *pnm* file
you simply pass a file to `read-pnm` function:
``` clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
=> nil

(slurp (io/file "test.pgm"))
=> P2
 3
 2
 4
 1 2 3
 4 5 6 ; prettified

(pnm/read-pnm (io/file "test.pgm"))
=> {:type :p2, :width 3, :height 2, :max-value 4, :map [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]}
```

Writing a file is just a matter of passing a map like the ones explained
above. It can include comments also which are always written after the header part.
``` clojure
(pnm/write-pnm {:type :p1 :width 1 :height 1 :map [[1]]} "out.pbm")
=> ...out.pbm file...

(slurp *1)
=> "P1
 1
 1
 1" ;prettified

(pnm/write-pnm
{:type :p3 :width 1 :height 1 :max-value 255 :map [[1]]}
"out.ppm"
#{"A comment" "Another comment"})
=> ...out.ppm file...

(slurp *1)
=> "P3
 1
 1
 255
 # Another comment
 # A comment
 255 255 255" ; prettified
```
